Random Forest was the slowest, but it scale better with more data than support vector machines.  The training time for decision trees and random tree increased much slower than support vector machines when the training set grew.  This means that support vector machines cannot be implemented on a larger scale whereas decisions trees and random forest can.  I decided to go with support vector machines since it was the most accurate, and the data set is small enough so computional resources aren't an issue.      "
